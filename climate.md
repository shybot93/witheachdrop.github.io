## The Importance of Water
Water is tightly woven into the everyday texture of life, intergral to our survival. Every single person on the planet has a relationship to water which is unique to them and where they live, whether is it in the driest of desserts, the wetest of rainforests or the frozen tundras. 

Despite water being a universal necessity regardless of living conditions, there is a disparity of access to water. While flooding and storms have been more frequent in South Asia, Africa is experiencing desertification. The East Coast of USA experiences greater hurricanes while the West Coast deals with droughts while fighting fires. 

Climate Change and the water cycle are heavily involved systems that no one country can tackle alone. Uncertainty about our relationship with water is also a shared experience. While our world leaders work hard together to secure this natural resource for humanity, we can band together, express ourselves, break the spiral of silence and let our voices be heard.
